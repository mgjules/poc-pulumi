# poc-pulumi

This project was created as a PoC Go microservice to experiment with Pulumi by provisioning an MVP Ringier Event Bus infrastructure. An internal production-ready product codenamed `Atlas` would later on stem from this project and be adopted by the Bus team to provision the current production infrastructure.

**THIS IS JUST A PROOF-OF-CONCEPT AND IS NOT MAINTAINED ANYMORE**
